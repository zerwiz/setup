# for-zerwiz-setup – Synced to homepage

**This repo (zerwiz/setup) is the canonical source.** We develop tools here.

`for-zerwiz-setup/` is a subset of scripts synced to WhyNotProductionsHomepage `docs/for-zerwiz-setup/`. Run from setup root:

```bash
./scripts/sync-to-homepage.sh
```

Then commit and push in the homepage repo to update the copy there. Curl URLs on the main README and in rules point to zerwiz/setup only.
